# Tic Tac Toe

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It was created with the help of **prompt engineering**, where natural language instructions were used to guide the development of the code and design step by step.

The goal of the project is not only to practice basic web development skills, but also to explore how prompt engineering can support and accelerate the process of building small interactive applications.
